Hi there,
My name is Nick Winters, I am currently learning Data Science at Lambda. So far I have learned about the different Python Data Science libraries. And I can not wait to learn how to use different libraries to understand multiple data frames! Data science is the perfect job for me, I love the fact that there are endless possibilities with it, and I will always be learning new things. The journey is well worth it, and I am here to tell you all about it!
